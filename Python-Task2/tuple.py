# Programme containing 7 different methods of tuples

# slicing of tuple

print("length of tuple is = ", len(myTup))

# printing element with maximum value
print("element with maximum value is = ", max(myTup))

# printing element with minimum value
print("element with minimum value is = ", min(myTup))

# printing the occurance of a specific element in tuple

# deleting the tuple
del tuple

# printing tuple in reverse order
